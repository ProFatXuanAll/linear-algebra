# Linear Algebra

Latex notes for reading Linear Algebra, 4th edition by Arnold J. Insel, Lawrence E. Spence, and Stephen H. Friedberg.

For anyone reading my proofs, I found that this book is heavily relied on set theory.
If you are not familiar with set theory, make sure you learn them first (you can also read my notes on set theory, see [my notes on Analysis I by Terence Tao](https://github.com/ProFatXuanAll/terence-tao-analysis), set theory is covered in chapter 3 and 8).
