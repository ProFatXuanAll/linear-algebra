\section{Vector Spaces}\label{sec 1.2}

\begin{definition}\label{1.2.1}
    A \textbf{vector space} (or \textbf{linear space}) $V$ over a field $F$ consists of a set on which two operations (called \textbf{addition} and \textbf{scalar multiplication}, respectively) are deÔ¨Åned so that for each pair of elements $x$, $y$ in $V$ there is a unique element $x + y$ in $V$, and for each element $a$ in $F$ and each element $x$ in $V$ there is a unique element $ax$ in $V$, such that the following conditions hold.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For all $x, y$ in $V$, $x + y = y + x$
              (commutativity of addition).
        \item For all $x, y, z$ in $V$, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$
              (associativity of addition).
        \item There exists an element in $V$ denoted by $0$ such that $x + 0 = x$ for each $x$ in $V$.
        \item For each element $x$ in $V$ there exists an element $y$ in $V$ such that $x + y = 0$.
        \item For each element $x$ in $V$, $1x = x$.
        \item For each pair of elements $a, b$ in $F$ and each element $x$ in $V$, $(ab)x = a(bx)$.
        \item For each element $a$ in $F$ and each pair of elements $x, y$ in $V$, $a(x + y) = ax + ay$.
        \item For each pair of elements $a, b$ in $F$ and each element $x$ in $V$, $(a + b)x = ax + bx$.
    \end{enumerate}
