\section{Vector Spaces}\label{sec:1.2}

\begin{defn}\label{1.2.1}
    A \textbf{vector space} (or \textbf{linear space}) \(V\) over a field \(F\) consists of a set on which two operations (called \textbf{addition} and \textbf{scalar multiplication}, respectively) are defined so that for each pair of elements \(x\), \(y\) in \(V\) there is a unique element \(x + y\) in \(V\), and for each element \(a\) in \(F\) and each element \(x\) in \(V\) there is a unique element \(ax\) in \(V\), such that the following conditions hold.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(VS \arabic*), ref=VS \arabic*]
        \item \label{1.2.1.1}
              For all \(x, y\) in \(V\), \(x + y = y + x\)
              (commutativity of addition).
        \item \label{1.2.1.2}
              For all \(x, y, z\) in \(V\), \(\p{x + y} + z = x + \p{y + z}\)
              (associativity of addition).
        \item \label{1.2.1.3}
              There exists an element in \(V\) denoted by \(0\) such that \(x + 0 = x\) for each \(x\) in \(V\).
        \item \label{1.2.1.4}
              For each element \(x\) in \(V\) there exists an element \(y\) in \(V\) such that \(x + y = 0\).
        \item \label{1.2.1.5}
              For each element \(x\) in \(V\), \(1x = x\).
        \item \label{1.2.1.6}
              For each pair of elements \(a, b\) in \(F\) and each element \(x\) in \(V\), \(\p{ab} x = a \p{bx}\).
        \item \label{1.2.1.7}
              For each element \(a\) in \(F\) and each pair of elements \(x, y\) in \(V\), \(a \p{x + y} = ax + ay\).
        \item \label{1.2.1.8}
              For each pair of elements \(a, b\) in \(F\) and each element \(x\) in \(V\), \(\p{a + b} x = ax + bx\).
    \end{enumerate}
    The elements \(x + y\) and \(ax\) are called the \textbf{sum} of \(x\) and \(y\) and the \textbf{product} of \(a\) and \(x\), respectively.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{1.2.2}
    The elements of the field \(F\) are called \textbf{scalars} and the elements of the vector space \(V\) are called \textbf{vectors}.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
    A vector space is frequently discussed in the text without explicitly mentioning its field of scalars.
    The reader is cautioned to remember, however, that \emph{every vector space is regarded as a vector space over a given field, which is denoted by \(F\)}.
    Occasionally we restrict our attention to the fields of real and complex numbers, which are denoted \(\R\) and \(\C\), respectively.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    \ref{1.2.1.2} permits us to unambiguously define the addition of any finite number of vectors
    (without the use of parentheses).
\end{note}

\begin{defn}\label{1.2.3}
    An object of the form \(\p{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n}\), where the entries \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) are elements of a field \(F\), is called an \textbf{\(n\)-tuple} with entries from \(F\).
    The elements \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) are called the \textbf{entries} or \textbf{components} of the \(n\)-tuple.
    Two \(n\)-tuples \(\p{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n}\) and \(\p{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n}\) with entries from a field \(F\) are called \textbf{equal} if \(a_i = b_i\) for \(i = 1, 2, \dots, n\).
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}\label{1.2.4}
    The set of all \(n\)-tuples with entries from a field \(F\) is denoted by \(F^n\).
    This set is a vector space over \(F\) with the operations of coordinatewise addition and scalar multiplication;
    that is, if \(u = \p{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n} \in F^n\), \(v = \p{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n} \in F^n\), and \(c \in F\), then
