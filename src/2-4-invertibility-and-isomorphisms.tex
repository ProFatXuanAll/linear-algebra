\section{Invertibility and Isomorphisms}\label{sec:2.4}

\begin{defn}\label{2.4.1}
  Let \(\V\) and \(\W\) be vector spaces over \(\F\), and let \(\T : \V \to \W\) be linear.
  A function \(\U : \W \to \V\) is said to be an \textbf{inverse} of \(\T\) if \(\T \U = \IT[\W]\) and \(\U \T = \IT[\V]\).
  If \(\T\) has an inverse, then \(\T\) is said to be \textbf{invertible}.
  If \(\T\) is invertible, then the inverse of \(\T\) is unique and is denoted by \(\T^{-1}\).
  The following facts hold for invertible functions T and U.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \((\T \U)^{-1} = \U^{-1} \T^{-1}\).
    \item \((\T^{-1})^{-1} = \T\);
          in particular, \(\T^{-1}\) is invertible.
  \end{itemize}
  We often use the fact that a function is invertible iff it is both one-to-one and onto.
  We can therefore restate \cref{2.5} as follows.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(\T : \V \to \W\) be a linear transformation, where \(\V\) and \(\W\) are finite-dimensional spaces over \(\F\) of equal dimension.
          Then \(\T\) is invertible if and only if \(\rk{\T} = \dim(\V)\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}\label{2.17}
  Let \(\V\) and \(\W\) be vector spaces over \(\F\), and let \(\T : \V \to \W\) be linear and invertible.
  Then \(\T^{-1} : \W \to \V\) is linear.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[\pf{2.17}]
  Let \(y_1, y_2 \in \W\) and \(c \in \F\).
  Since \(\T\) is onto and one-to-one, there exist unique vectors \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) such that \(\T(x_1) = y_1\) and \(\T(x_2) = y_2\).
  Thus \(x_1 = \T^{-1}(y_1)\) and \(x_2 = \T^{-1}(y_2)\);
  so
  \begin{align*}
    \T^{-1}(c y_1 + y_2) & = \T^{-1}(c \T(x_1) + \T(x_2))   &  & \text{(by \cref{2.4.1})}    \\
                         & = \T^{-1}(\T(c x_1 + x_2))       &  & \text{(by \cref{2.1.2}(b))} \\
                         & = c x_1 + x_2                    &  & \text{(by \cref{2.4.1})}    \\
                         & = c \T^{-1}(x_1) + \T^{-1}(x_2). &  & \text{(by \cref{2.4.1})}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{2.4.2}
  If \(\T\) is a linear transformation between vector spaces of equal (finite) dimension, then the conditions of being invertible, one-to-one, and onto are all equivalent.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}[\pf{2.4.2}]
  By \cref{2.5} we see that this is true.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}\label{2.4.3}
  Let \(A \in \ms{n}{n}{\F}\).
  Then \(A\) is \textbf{invertible} if there exists an \(B \in \ms{n}{n}{\F}\) such that \(AB = BA = I_n\).
\end{defn}

\begin{cor}\label{2.4.4}
  If \(A\) is invertible, then the matrix \(B\) such that \(AB = BA = I\) is unique.
  The matrix \(B\) is called the \textbf{inverse} of \(A\) and is denoted by \(A^{-1}\).
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}[\pf{2.4.4}]
  If \(C\) were another such matrix, then
  \[
    C = CI = C(AB) = (CA)B = IB = B.
  \]
  Thus \(B\) is unique.
\end{proof}
